# Project State — SyntaxTreeHybrid

## Task Counter: 1

## Project Description
Browser-based interactive syntax tree diagram builder for linguistics. Dual-interface: visual drag-and-drop on Fabric.js canvas + bracket notation text editor, kept in bidirectional sync. Vanilla JavaScript, no build step, single HTML page.

## Current State
- Initial memory system setup (cold start).
- All core application files are in place and functional: tree-model, canvas-manager, bracket-parser, bracket-serializer, sync-engine, app, index.html.
- 39 reference diagram patterns defined and tested.
- CLAUDE.md and .memory/ system created in this task.

## Active Work
- No active development tasks beyond memory system initialization.

## Open Threads
- None at this time.

## Recent Changes
- Task 1: Created CLAUDE.md with project configuration, .memory/instructions.md, .memory/project-map.md, .memory/knowledge-base.md, and this state file. Cold start complete.

## Direction
- Project is stable and functional. Future work may include additional diagram patterns, UI improvements, or additional export formats.
